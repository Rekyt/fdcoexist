\title{Compute trait distance between species}
\usage{
compute_compet_distance(trait_weights, traits)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait_weights}{data.frame with at least three columns equal to \code{trait}
(giving the name of the concerned traits in \code{traits}
df), \code{growth_weight} the relative weight of the trait in
growth and \code{compet_weight} the relative weight of the
trait in competition.}

\item{traits}{a species-traits data.frame with species as rownames and
traits as numeric columns with names matching
\code{trait_weights} column \code{trait}}
}
\value{
an euclidean distance matrix (of type matrix)
}
\description{
This function compute trait distance between species using a trait matrix and
a trait weights data.frame. For all the traits with competition weights not
equal to zero, it computes a weighted 'composite trait' that is then used to
compute euclidea trait distance between species.
